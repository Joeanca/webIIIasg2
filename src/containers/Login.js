/* 4.The first thing the user must experience is a log-in screen if the user is not already logged-in. The form must provide mechanism for entering email and password. It will display a Bulma notification if the credential information is incorrect. This notification must disappear once the user starts entering information into the login form. I would recommend adding in the log-in capabilities after you have most of the main functionality working. I will provide you with more guidance on how best to implement this in Node and react. */
